              Pastor Odekunle's journey began in 1998, when he felt a divine
              burden to bring hope and transformation through the undiluted Word
              of God. What started as an evening youth fellowship in a primary
              school classroom in Ibadan has since grown into a vibrant
              movement, reaching many with the gospel through prayer, prophetic
              ministry, and outreach. He is an alumnus of Living Spring Bible
              College, where he received his theological training, equipping him
              to shepherd the growing church he founded.
